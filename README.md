# RailsUp

The better way to install and run Ruby on Rails. Bring your agents. They're welcome.

## What

A single binary written in Rust that handles Ruby installation, Rails setup, and exposes an MCP server for AI-assisted development.

## Goals

- `curl -fsSL https://bkt.sh/adamstac/railsup/install.sh | sh`
- `railsup install` - installs Ruby and Rails
- `railsup new myapp` - creates a new Rails app
- `railsup dev` - runs the dev server
- That's it. You're building.

## Status

Early development. Everything is subject to change.
